In my studies of CNNs I created and tested the effectiveness of different network structures as well as retrained existing models. 
I trained the pretrained model Alexnet for a range of image recognition tasks such as counting the number of rectangle in an image.
Early attempts had low success but I was able to train a network that achieved 96% accuracy.
