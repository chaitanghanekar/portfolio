In response to wildfires that had recently caused emergency action in Kelowna, our group set out to create an application to better coordinate community response. The application was developed in Java using Android Studio and the realtime database was done with Firebase.
The app serves as the central hub presenting essential information at a glance: weather updates, air quality details, evacuation levels, community posts, and the closest fire location.
The interactive map visually represents fire locations using customized fire pins. It also displays pins for report requests and has a unique pin for accommodation, offering detailed information upon selection. Users can contribute by adding their fire markers, reports, accommodation options, and necessary requests.

The Community task serves as a hub displaying a feed of accommodations, where compassionate members of the community offer assistance, ranging from free food and shelter to essential supplies like water. Additionally, this task showcases requests from individuals in the community seeking necessary materials, transportation, volunteers, or other aid forms. It creates a space for mutual support, fostering an environment where people can extend a helping hand to those in need, fostering solidarity within the community. At the same time, users can contribute by adding their posts, offering a chance for them to participate and contribute actively to the community's support network.
