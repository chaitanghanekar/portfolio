In response to wildfires that had recently caused emergency action in Kelowna, our group set out to create an application to better coordinate community response.
Users could create posts to either offer accommodation or request aid. These posts all had a location attached and could be viewed on an interactive map for quick and easy use.
The application was developed in Java using Android Studio and the realtime database was done with Firebase.
