The goal was to create a robust website for users to search and view products as well as view the changing prices. Upon account creation users could also comment and add products to a tracked list. With moderation in mind a whole admin tool suite was developed as well. 
Administrators could moderate user accounts and comments as well as view site metrics. The website was developed using the Bootstrap framework for the frontend with PHP and JavaScript for the backend.
Pages served data from a realtime data base where the information was updated on the site asyncrounously using AJAX.
