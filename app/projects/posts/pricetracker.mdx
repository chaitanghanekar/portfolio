Upon account creation users can also comment and add products to a tracked list. With moderation in mind, a whole admin tool suite was developed as well. 
Administrators can moderate user accounts and comments as well as view site metrics. The website was developed using the Bootstrap framework for the frontend with PHP and JavaScript for the backend.

Pages served data from a realtime data base where the information was updated on the site asyncrounously using AJAX. 
This page uses SQL along with Chart.js and AJAX to display graphs and data about the given product.

This page showcases all the products that were queried using SQL via the Search bar on every page in the web-app. On this page, you can also filter the search with a modal that pops up when you click the Filter button next to the Search bar. The code looks for the selected dropdown menu items (Category, Subcategory, & Items per Page) and modifies the SQL query for searching the products appropriately.
